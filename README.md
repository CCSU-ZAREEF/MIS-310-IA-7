# MIS-310-IA-7

This Python script implements a simple population lookup tool using a dictionary and user input validation. It starts with a dictionary called popData that maps two-letter region codes (for example, CA, TX, FL) to their population values in millions. The retrieve_pop function takes a region code and the dictionary, checks if the code exists using the in operator, and returns the corresponding population if found or None if the code is not present.

The main function first gathers all valid region codes from the dictionary into a list and then builds a comma-separated string of these codes for display in error messages. It then enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter a country (actually state/region) code, strips extra whitespace, and converts it to uppercase. It calls retrieve_pop to look up the population. If the code is valid, it prints the population and ends the loop. If the code is invalid, it shows an error message listing all valid codes and asks the user if they want to try again. The loop continues as long as the user answers yes or y; otherwise, the program prints “Program terminated.” and exits. This assignment demonstrates dictionary lookups, string cleaning, loops, and user-friendly error handling.
